      <p>The latest wave of commodity virtual reality equipment has allowed
      unprecedented access to virtual experiences for consumers and researchers
      alike. Leading technology companies today are becoming increasingly
      invested in VR audio with new products, such as Facebook’s Spatial
      Workstation and Google’s Resonance Audio, that facilitate the use of
      advanced spatial audio techniques with popular game engines and digital
      audio workstations. However, most modern VR platforms impart an ancillary
      role to audio, where sounds serve to amplify visual immersion. As a
      result, audio remains an afterthought for many content developers and VR
      researchers despite its inherent role in immersion. It is therefore
      necessary to elaborate ways in which we can think natively about VR audio
      and articulate the role of sound in the ultimate displays of the future.
      In this workshop, we aim to not only highlight recent developments in VR
      audio, but also identify the needs of the VR community in creating
      compelling virtual auditory experiences for the next generation of
      immersive media. Accordingly, we seek submissions that address such topics
      as:</p>

        <li>Best practices in VR audio
        <li>Creativity support tools for spatial audio
        <li>Analyses of new and existing authoring tools for VR audio
        <li>Audio-first and audio-only VRs
        <li>Virtual Interfaces for Musical Expression
        <li>Sonic Interaction Design for Virtual Environments (SIVE)
        <li>Acoustic modelling systems and techniques for VR
        <li>Auditory perception in virtual environments
        <li>VR audio and accessibility

      </p>
      The workshop will feature paper presentations followed by demo sessions
      and a round table discussion. In addition to reports of completed research
      projects, the submissions can include position papers and late-breaking
      results. The length of the submissions can range from 2 to 5 pages based
      on the contribution. Paper presentations can be accompanied by
      demonstrations at the workshop. Proceedings of the workshop will be
      published in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Submissions should be
      prepared in IEEE Computer Society VGTC format
